# My_Portfolioaj17
This is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, projects, and work as a web developer.
The website is designed with a clean and responsive layout to give a professional look and feel.

✨ About the Project
This portfolio includes:
✅ A landing section with an introduction
✅ Details about my skills and expertise
✅ A projects section highlighting my work
✅ Contact information

🛠️ How I Created It
I built this portfolio using:
HTML for the structure of the pages
CSS for styling and responsive design
JavaScript for interactivity

It is a static website — no frameworks were used. The design is fully custom and coded from scratch.
I used GitHub to manage the project and version control. The site is deployed using Netlify for fast and reliable hosting.
