This is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, projects, and work as a web developer.
The website is designed with a clean and responsive layout to give a professional look and feel.

✨ About the Project
This portfolio includes: <br>
✅ A landing section with an introduction <br>
✅ Details about my skills and expertise <br>
✅ A projects section highlighting my work <br>

🛠️ How I Created It <br>
I built this portfolio using: <br>
HTML for the structure of the pages <br>
CSS for styling and responsive design <br>
JavaScript for interactivity <br>

It is a static website — no frameworks were used. The design is fully custom and coded from scratch.
I used GitHub to manage the project and version control. The site is deployed using Netlify for fast and reliable hosting.
